# IndexerQueryProcessor
This is the second practical work of the Information Retrieval class at UFMG.

Its goal is to implement a Indexer and a Query Processor. The specification (english) can be seen at the pa2.pdf file. The documentation (portuguese) for my implementation can be seen at the Documentacao.pdf file.
