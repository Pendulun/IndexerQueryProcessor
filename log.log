The team played in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and was the Triple-A affiliate of the major league Milwaukee Brewers (2015–2018), Colorado Rockies (1993–2014), and Cleveland Indians (1988–1992). The Sky Sox won the PCL title in 1992 and 1995.Contents1 History2 Notable alumni3 References4 External linksHistory[edit]From 1950 to 1958, the original incarnation of the Colorado Springs Sky Sox were a Class A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in the Western League. The Sky Sox's nickname originated with their affiliation with the White Sox. The Pikes Peak region was without professional baseball for 30 years until 1988, when the Hawaii Islanders of the PCL relocated to Colorado Springs and became the second incarnation of the Sky Sox. From 1988 to 1992 the Sky Sox were the Triple-A affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. When Denver was awarded a major league franchise for the 1993 season, the new Colorado Rockies arranged for the Sky Sox to become their top farm team.[1]During their first season, the Sky Sox moved from Spurgeon Stadium (in Memorial Park) to the brand new Sky Sox Stadium, later known as Security Service Field. The ballpark, on the eastern edge of Colorado Springs, cost US$3.4 million[2] to build and held 8,500 spectators. In later years, the Sky Sox invested over $8 million in ballpark renovations which included a new video scoreboard, redesigned entrance plaza, new picnic facility and banquet hall. It has the highest elevation of any professional ballpark in the United States: its natural grass field sits at 6,531 feet (1,991 m) above sea level.On June 21, 2017, team owner David G. Elmore announced the relocation of the Sky Sox Triple-A franchise to San Antonio, Texas, in 2019, with the team continuing to compete in the Pacific Coast League as the San Antonio Missions, who were previously members of the Double-A Texas League.[3] Concurrent with this move, the Rookie Helena Brewers of the Pioneer League relocated to Colorado Springs, operating as the Rocky Mountain Vibes.[4]Sky Sox logo (1993–2008)Sky Sox cap (2000–2008)Notable alumni[edit] Brad Ausmus Gabe KaplerSandy Alomar, Jr.Nolan ArenadoGarrett AtkinsBrad AusmusAlbert BelleVinny CastillaAlan CockrellCraig CounsellJoe GirardiJimmy GobbleCarlos GonzálezBrad HawpeTodd HeltonMatt HollidayDoug JonesGabe KaplerJuan PierreScott PodsednikJim ThomeMike Hargrove (Manager)Charlie Manuel (Manager)References[edit]^ "Colorado Springs, Colorado Encyclopedia".
